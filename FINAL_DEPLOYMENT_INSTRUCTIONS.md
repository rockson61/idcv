## 🎯 Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Remove Conflicting Lockfiles

**Open your Terminal** (NOT in Cursor sandbox) and run:

```bash
# Remove lockfiles outside workspace
rm /Users/rockson61/yarn.lock 2>/dev/null
rm /Users/rockson61/package-lock.json 2>/dev/null

# Navigate to project
cd /Users/rockson61/Downloads/idc
```

### Step 2: Test Build Locally

Choose ONE of these methods:

#### Option A: Using pnpm (Recommended)
```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf .next

# Build with more memory
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" pnpm run build
```

#### Option B: Using npm
```bash
# Clean build
rm -rf .next

# Build with more memory
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=8192" npm run build
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub

```bash
# Push the commit
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Deploy to Vercel

**Vercel will auto-deploy** when you push. Monitor at:
- https://vercel.com/rockson61/idcv

If auto-deploy doesn't trigger:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard
2. Click "Redeploy"
3. **Uncheck** "Use existing build cache"
4. Click "Redeploy"

## ⚠️ Build Time Warnings

Your site has **2,396 pages**, so expect:
- **Local build**: 8-15 minutes (first time), 3-5 minutes (cached)
- **Vercel build**: 10-20 minutes (first time), 5-10 minutes (cached)

**This is normal for large sites!**

---

## 🔧 If Build Fails

### Issue: Memory Error
```bash
# Increase Node memory even more
NODE_OPTIONS="--max-old-space-size=12288" pnpm run build
```

### Issue: Vercel Timeout
Your `vercel.json` already has:
```json
{
  "functions": {
    "app/**/*.tsx": {
      "memory": 3008,
      "maxDuration": 60
    }
  }
}
```

If still timing out, upgrade Vercel plan or reduce pages.

### Issue: Type Errors
All type errors are fixed. If new ones appear:
```bash
# Run type check
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## 💡 Quick Troubleshooting

### Build succeeds locally but fails on Vercel?
- Clear Vercel build cache
- Check environment variables in Vercel dashboard
- Review Vercel build logs for specific error

### Build fails locally?
- Ensure Node.js version ≥ 18.x
- Delete `node_modules` and reinstall: `pnpm install`
- Delete `.next` folder: `rm -rf .next`

### Still having issues?
Send me the **exact error message** from:
- Terminal output (local build), OR
- Vercel build logs (deployment)

## 🔐 Environment Variables (if needed)

Your site doesn't require env variables for basic deployment.

If you add features later that need them:
1. Go to Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add variables
3. Redeploy
